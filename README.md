# Photo-Slider
 A simple application that is built using python as a photo slider

 ## all you need to do is just edit the image files variable in line 38 and put your own list, for simplification, I wrote the name of the files.

 ### However, you need to just edit the names or put the absolute path of the folder that contains the photos
